# Brazilian Census Sample
## About
These scripts compute statistics from the sample of the Brazilian Demographic Census. This sample is a stratified sample for every municipality where data collected from each census tract is expanded to its weighing area and calculated for the total population.

This project relies on Thomas Lumley's work. More details on reference.

The example dataset is the sample of Brazilian Demographics Census subsetted by the [Montes Claros municipality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montes_Claros). For comparison, it is used the [Sistema IBGE de Recuperação Automática (SIDRA)](https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/pesquisa/censo-demografico/demografico-2010/inicial).
